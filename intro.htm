      <h3>Distance Learning</h3>
      <p>It was a turning point of my life when I started learning throughout Internet. My inflexible schedule with two young babies and inadequate financial situation were always my cliche excuses to put off from learning at school. I realized that learning maybe easier and closer to me than I ever thought when I introduced my kids <a href="https://www.ixl.com/">math website</a> to learn online. I started learning English and Technology throughout Internet and I am still taking coding courses at Massive open online courses(MOOCs), which offer large-scale interactive participation and open access through the World Wide Web or other network technologies.</p>
      <p><img src="_images/Distance Learning.jpg" alt="Distance Learning" width="200" height="136" class="flowLeft">Distance Learning opens the way to see the word for me. And now, I hope I can inspire people who are eager to learn just like I was.</p>
